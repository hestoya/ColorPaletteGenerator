# Color Palette Generator

## 📜 Overview

This **Color Palette Generator** is a Blazor Web App that generates random RGB color palettes and converts them to HEX. It is designed to help users discover color combinations for their design projects.

The app is based on a tutorial I followed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZA2hKx3SEY&t=827s). I built it to practice working with Blazor Web Apps and enhance my understanding of web development.

7. **Color Visualization**: Display the generated colors in various UI elements (buttons, background, etc.).
8. **Export Options**: Enable users to export palettes in various formats like PNG, CSS variables, SCSS, or JSON.
